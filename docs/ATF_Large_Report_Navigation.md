# Large report navigation — retained evidence, incremental work

## Contract

Large HTML reports retain every supplied comparison and original inline PNG.
Navigation changes when layout and timing metadata are prepared, not which
evidence is published or how a test verdict is evaluated.

| Responsibility | Invariant |
|---|---|
| assertion cells | native default preview remains 240; independent captured verdicts and complete supplied bodies remain unchanged |
| hidden tables | no eager wrapper, intrinsic measurement or resize subscription before visibility; known hidden views also skip geometry reads |
| layout changes | coalesce affected roots once per animation frame; descendants of a pending ancestor do not trigger another subtree scan |
| screenshot dialogs | unrelated appended UI does not rescan every table in the document; original PNG bytes, local captions and return context remain intact |
| timing | resolve a card's original execution marker once per aggregation pass; reset the cache at the next pass, including absent markers |
| projected views | capture the source-owner/scenario index once per projection pass and share it across Category, Fails and Overview |
| dynamic content | identical class/open writes are ignored; actual mutations are coalesced before content invalidation; real child/text mutations increment a content revision; new/reopened/resized tables receive native column allocation; removed tables retire resize observations |
| renderer scope | the table allocator is shared by Extent and fallback; duration aggregation belongs to Extent |

The report stays self-contained. This change does not move evidence to another
file, virtualize away owners, remove screenshots or substitute observations
for assertion rows.

## Permanent verification

| Owner | Proof |
|---|---|
| LargeNavigationFixture | four original owners, 600 comparison groups, 12,004 captured comparison rows and four complete synthetic PNG checkpoints |
| LargeReportNavigationBrowserComponentTest | repeated owner switches, targeted assertion/PNG paths and return; bulk expansion on the neutral fixture or at most two explicitly selected external owners; per-owner SHA-256 inventory of original cells/bodies and canonical PNG payloads/references before/after; a one-character payload mutation is rejected |
| EvidenceTableVisibilityComponentTest | identical presentation writes do not remeasure; actual cell-style changes do; known hidden views skip geometry; closed evidence remains structurally untouched; opening/reopening and direct text-node mutation receive full measured columns |
| RecordedPublicationTimingComponentTest | execution and transport stay independent of publication; removed/replaced markers refresh at a subsequent aggregation |
| adjacent browser families | standard UI/API tables, fallback layout, disclosure state, source labels and J16 screenshot viewport/return contracts |

- The optional atf.navigation.input property defaults to targeted paths.
- An explicit atf.navigation.expandOwners accepts at most two distinct, zero-based owner indices; duplicates, negative/out-of-range indices and unbounded requests are rejected.
- Each selected owner is expanded once, with the same canonical evidence inventory before and after.
- This verifies publication/rendering, not a fresh business or device execution.

## Measurement and boundaries

- Browser readiness, owner interaction and publication clocks have different scopes.
- A passing screenshot contract does not certify a fresh Android execution or its business oracle.
- Very large required evidence still consumes parser, layout and image memory; a content budget is not a total HTML or browser-heap guarantee.
- Performance observations never turn a captured FAIL into PASS.

[Current release acceptance](ATF_Reporting_J18_Verification.md) records source and physical-JAR
checks, the large archived Android artifact and separate J1–J4 consumer sanity.

## Cold startup and readiness

| Lifecycle | Required behavior |
|---|---|
| DOMContentLoaded/load | initialize once and activate only the requested hash target; an empty hash opens Overview |
| native Spark load | reconcile the four navigation hrefs after the vendor rewrites them; do not reactivate or restart the readiness clock |
| readiness | publish only after successful normalization; a controlled failure remains unready until real recovery |
| page load | record the completed navigation timing independently; an unfinished load remains unknown rather than zero |
| dynamic content | retain observers, revision invalidation and scheduled normalization for later mutations |
| deadlines | readiness/action 10,000 ms; navigation 45,000 ms; existing API matrices retain 5,000 ms |

J0 maintains ColdStartReadinessComponentTest, documented in
[the local producer evidence](ATF_Reporting_J18_Verification.md).
The permanent test checks five initial destinations, startup scenario deep links, native link
repair, repeated load and failure/recovery. An external atf.cold.input runs
three fresh Chromium processes against the same complete artifact.

## Native timeline labels

| Boundary | Invariant |
|---|---|
| Spark template | encode the full timeline owner key as a JSON string; preserve quotes, line breaks, backslashes and Unicode |
| captured data | retain the exact caller label and original duration; no trimming or inferred verdict |
| vendor upgrade | fail explicitly when the pinned native key expression changes, instead of silently publishing invalid script |
| permanent proof | TimelineTitleEncodingComponentTest executes the real embedded script and rejects browser errors; timestamp regressions stay separate |

[The release record](ATF_Reporting_J18_Verification.md) includes the current J4
Learning witness and neutral source/JAR contracts. The producer owns the
implementation and permanent tests; consumers retain their own oracles.
